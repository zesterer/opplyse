# Opplyse

A clean, efficient GTK3 text editor for programmers. The big brother of Vulcan.

## What is Opplyse?

Opplyse is a text editor created with C++ and GTK 3. It is designed to be clean but capable in design while being quick and efficient in operation. It is total redesign of the original Vulcan text editor (https://github.com/zesterer/vulcan).

## What can Opplyse do?

Here's the planned / implemented feature list. Implemented features are denoted with a '칙춮춦', incomplete features are denoted with a '~' and absent features are denoted with a '칙춮춪'.

[칙춮춪] Multi-file editing
[칙춮춪] Edit detection
[칙춮춪] Basic theming / configuration
[칙춮춪] Smooth, animated UI
[칙춮춪] Keyboard shortcuts for quick access to functionality
[칙춮춪] Syntax highlighting
[칙춮춪] Built-in VTE Terminal
[칙춮춪] Line numbering
[칙춮춪] Plugin support

## Why recreate Vulcan?

Vulcan's codebase became increasingly untidy and difficult to maintain. I decided that, since the project had been inactive for a number of months anyway, I should redesign and rebuild Vulcan in the same style as the original.
